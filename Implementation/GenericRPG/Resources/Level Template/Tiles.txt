[MapCharacter] [FunctionWord] [Parameter(s)] [ImageFilePath] [Comments]

[MapCharacter] is the character used in map.txt for the level

[FunctionWord] describes the function of the tile; it can be:
	path (walkable tile, nothing happens)
	wall (unwalkable tile)
	inportal (transports the player to another position within the level)
	outportal (transports the player to a position within a different level)
	start (where the player should start in the level by default; only one character should be this and this character should only be used once)

[ImageFilePath] specifies the file path for the image that should be displayed as the tile (using "blank" will make no image show)

[Parameter(s)] are any parameters taken by the FunctionWord:
	inportal takes [MapCharacter] and outportal takes [MapCharacter] [Level];
	[MapCharacter] defines the mapcharacter that receives the character in the given level (should only be used once in that level map)
	[Level] defines which level the player will be sent to; if left blank, the level is assumed to be this level

[Comments] should be used for clarification and will not affect the map

file and level names cannot have spaces in them or it will break

for example:

S start blank
0 path blank
1 wall wall.png
A inportal 3 demonic\portal.png
3 inportal A demonic\portal.png A and 3 are portals to each other within this same level
C outportal X level-3 level-3-portal.jpg C takes the player to level 3, at the character labeled level 3
